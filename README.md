# An Early Warning Monitoring System for Undesirable Neighborhood Change in Buffalo

 More description about this project: https://www.buffalo.edu/eln/students/project-portal/host-page.host.html/content/shared/www/eln/project-portal/project-profiles/active-projects/early-warning-monitoring.detail.html

The goal of the proposed project is to build such a system. Undergraduate students are collecting and beginning to analyze the requisite data to construct this system. The plan for the coming semesters is to then a) build a prototype system for early warning monitoring, b) present this system to members of the UB Center for Urban Studies and/or officials at the city of Buffalo for feedback, c) to iteratively improve the system and d) to eventually use the system in practice to assist scholars and city officials to identify potential undesirable neighborhood change within the city before it begins. Prof. Joseph will primarily be responsible for helping students to understand and leverage data science approaches that underlie the early warning system. We anticipate that eventually, there will be opportunities for interdisciplinary work for students from outside of the CSE department as well.
